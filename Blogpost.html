<p>Are you constantly stressed about unpaid bills, forgotten subscriptions, or unexpected expenses</p>
<p>depleting your savings? You're not alone in this financial chaos. Sudden expenses can disrupt</p>
<p>your financial stability, forcing you to dip into savings or accrue debt. The stress of remembering</p>
<p>numerous bill due dates can lead to costly late fees and a hit to your credit score. Those $5 and</p>
<p>$10 subscriptions might not seem like much, but they accumulate, silently draining your budget.</p>
<p>Imagine a life where bills are paid on time, subscriptions are monitored, and you're prepared for</p>
<p>unexpected expenses without lifting a finger. That's the power of automating your finances.</p>
<p>Financial automation is setting up systems to manage your money seamlessly, ensuring bills,</p>
<p>savings, and investments are taken care of automatically. By automating your finances, you</p>
<p>eliminate the stress of manual money management, avoid late fees, keep track of subscriptions,</p>
<p>and steadily build your savings for unexpected expenses.</p>
<p>Ready to regain control and bring order to your financial life? Let's dive into the comprehensive</p>
<p>guide to automating your finances and ensuring financial stability and growth.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to take to automate your finances:</p>
<p>STEP 1: Receiving your check</p>
<p>- Opt in for a direct deposit if you’re not already. Avoid paper checks at any cost, they will</p>
<p>slow down money going into your account.</p>
<p>- Have notifications for when you get paid so that you can be aware of the money going</p>
<p>into your bank account.</p><p>STEP 2: Budgeting</p>
<p>- Determine what your budget is depending on your monthly expenses that you will</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>guaranteed pay for every month (rent, food, transportation, etc.).</p>
<p>There are several types of budgets out there, but you need to pick one and stick to it (we</p>
<p>have a page just like this one, but specifically for budgeting in detail).</p>
<p>- Choose a budgeting app to help you automatically budget (we recommend ours).</p>
<p>STEP 3: Automating</p>
<p>- With your app of choice, you may or may not be able to automate all of your finances in</p>
<p>one place, but with Jackpot Automations, you can!</p>
<p>- Connect your bank account to the app safely as well as any investment accounts or bill</p>
<p>collectors. Now your finances should all be accessible in one place.</p>
<p>- Review your previous transactions and subscriptions and adjust as needed</p>
<p>- Once the end of the month hits (or subscription period hits), you now have the option to</p>
<p>pay all bills and subscriptions in full or cancel or dispute any charges all in one place</p>
<p>STEP 4: Attacking goals</p><p>- Ensure that you have your financial goals set into the app (savings, investing, etc.). The</p>
<p>app should set out a plan and keep you updated on how much effort is needed to</p><p>achieve the goal as well as if you are ‘on track’</p>
<p>- Goal setting is also automated, so no need to jump through hoops and calculate!</p><p>STEP 5: Review and rebalance</p>
<p>- Your app should give you notifications on how your finances are doing overall</p>
<p>Is your budget on track?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>- Are you overpaying for subscriptions?</p>
<p>- Have your subscriptions gone up?</p>
<p>- You invested $X amount so far this year, here’s how you are performing</p>
<p>- You are spending X% less than you did 2 months ago, good job!</p>
<p>- Etc.</p><p>- With Jackpot Automations, you will have this and more!</p>
<p>- Depending on how you are doing financially, you may or may not want to adjust your</p>
<p>budget and goals over time, but the app should automatically present you the results.</p>
<p>With these steps, you’ll have set up a system where your money is automatically sorted, saving</p>
<p>you time and preventing financial oversights. Start your journey to financial stability and freedom</p>
<p>through effective and effortless automation today!</p>
